**** Fix the watch/computed properties
**** Plan for a new, blank board as well as incoming moves
**** Add some sort of blip when a new move comes in (method?)
*** TODO Move the game board to a new component?
**** Game board should just take the pgn and arrange itself to display it
**** Take the styling functions into the new component
