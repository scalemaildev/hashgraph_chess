* NOW
** TODO Migrate any possible game panel functionality to vuex
*** TODO Vuex handling of the submission status? (not session storage)
** TODO Additional handling for incoming moves/messages
*** Will first require the vuex migration
*** TODO Handle for submitting move when the sub never comes back (timeout?)
* ON DECK
** TODO Add displayed turn # for current displayed position beneath board (and pgn?)
** TODO Step forward/back through chess moves history
** TODO Game over handling
*** Don't accept any more moves
*** Display who won
** TODO Resign button (with client-side validation like a move)
** TODO Left and Right alignment for player 1/2 in the messages window
** TODO Need to add support for handling promotions
**** users suggest a modal window with an extra menu option for promo
* FUTURE
** TODO Error handling for when move submit fails (revert to original state)
*** Should only fail if there's a loss of connection?
** TODO Need a timeout for topic subbing (and visible error message)
** TODO Footer with terms of use, github link, and credits to start page(s)
*** Artist for sprites was Daniela De Lena
*** Mention hedera discord and stack overflow
*** And modules like nuxt-socket-io and chess.js
** TODO Move the game board to a new component?
**** Game board should just take the pgn and arrange itself to display it
**** Take the styling functions into the new component
**** This could use vuex (not sessionstorage) for everything
** TODO Change player validation to use public key method
** TODO Do another pass at the css styling and ALL breakpoint settings
** TODO Replace grid input method with drag and drog
** TODO Big cleanup and refactoring run
* BUGS
