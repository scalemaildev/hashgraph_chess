* NOW
** TODO Find out if client exists on match page before doing anything
** TODO Subscription should find out if a sub already exists
*** This is probably why there were double messages in the chat app
** TODO Build out matchCreation message handling
*** Match creation should create the object in topic subs
*** Set the players to the account id's
*** Then init the match components
* FUTURE
** TODO Build out the Chatmessage handling
*** Messages means chat messages? Find a better term
*** Messages should be pushed to the messages array
*** Needs a validation that the message came from a player
** TODO Get a chat window and message text field into the game page
*** TODO Only accept messages from players
** TODO Get a chessboard.js with chess.js rules into the game page
** TODO Chess moves go to the chess moves array
**** Needs a validation that the move came from the current player(?)
**** Needs a validatino that the chess move was legal(?)
**** Chess.js might take care of the above
** TODO Modify chessboard to send and receive moves over HCS
** TODO Add a resume game feature to connect to an existing topic id
** TODO Limit moves and chat messages to valid account id's
*** Use the submit key feature for the topic messages
*** Will need to have another screen where player 1 is given the submit key to copy
*** Will need a panel on the game screen to enter the submit key
