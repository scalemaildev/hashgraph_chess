** TODO Get chat window to scroll on new messages
* FUTURE
** TODO Get a chessboard.js with chess.js rules into the game page
** TODO Chess moves go to the chess moves array
**** Needs a validation that the move came from the current player(?)
**** Needs a validatino that the chess move was legal(?)
**** Chess.js might take care of the above
** TODO Modify chessboard to send and receive moves over HCS
** TODO Limit moves and chat messages to valid account id's
*** Use the public key method from discord screens
** TODO Need a timeout for topic subscription (and error message)
