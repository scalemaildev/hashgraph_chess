* NOW
** TODO Chess move input field
*** DONE Text input field for square and another for move
*** DONE Send button as well as form with enter key
*** TODO Use pgn validation to validate the moves for the square (vuelidate)
*** TODO Test with console.log() first
* FUTURE
** TODO Chess moves go to the chess moves array
**** Needs a validation that the move came from the current player(?)
**** Needs a validation that the chess move was legal(?)
**** Chess.js might take care of the above
** TODO Modify chessboard to send and receive moves over HCS
** TODO Add vuelidate to message box to prevent blank messages
** TODO Add pgn info for current displayed position
** TODO Step forward/back through chess moves history
** TODO Who's turn is it? On game panel
*** White To Move, Black To Move, or Game Over
*** v-show for if its the current player's turn
** TODO Do xl breakpoints and check everything on big monitor
** TODO Observer mode handling
- Disable chat and moves for non-players
** TODO Game over handling
- Don't accept any more moves
- Display who won
** TODO Add footer with terms of use, github link, and credits to start page(s)
** TODO Need a timeout for topic subbing (and visible error message)
** TODO Limit moves and chat messages to valid account id's
*** Use the public key method from discord screens
** TODO Resign button (with client-side validation like a move)
* BUGS
** The chat window doesn't scroll to the bottom on new messages
