* NOW
** TODO Fix the topic subscription method chain
*** Look in the NewMatchPanel component as well as matches _slug
*** Should probably move the method to vuex
*** Have the method invoked only from the _slug (newmatch should just route to _slug)
*** Chain goes sessionStorage -> server index -> hashgraph
** TODO Fix the match page showing that client is not initialized during the loading period
** TODO If player inits their client on the match page it should subscribe to the topic afterwards
** TODO Add Join Match Panel
** TODO Build out matchCreation message handling
*** TODO Match creation should create the object in topic subs
**** Set the players to the account id's
** TODO Build out the Chatmessage handling
*** Messages means chat messages? Find a better term
*** TODO Messages should be pushed to the messages array
**** Needs a validation that the message came from a player
* FUTURE
** TODO Each match page should async load the topic messages from HCS
*** TODO Needs a loading spinner for initial load
*** TODO Needs a method for subscribing to the topic
*** TODO Needs a method for handling new messages from the topic
*** TODO Needs a method for parsing the topic's init message
** TODO Get a chat window and message text field into the game page
*** TODO Only accept messages from players
** TODO Get a chessboard.js with chess.js rules into the game page
** TODO Chess moves go to the chess moves array
**** Needs a validation that the move came from the current player(?)
**** Needs a validatino that the chess move was legal(?)
**** Chess.js might take care of the above
** TODO Modify chessboard to send and receive moves over HCS
** TODO Add a resume game feature to connect to an existing topic id
** TODO Limit moves and chat messages to valid account id's
