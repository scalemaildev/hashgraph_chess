* NOW
** TODO Chess move input
*** DONE Text input field for square and another for move
*** DONE Send button as well as form with enter key
*** TODO Use pgn validation to validate the moves for the square (vuelidate)
*** TODO Fix up the emit stuff
*** TODO Pass the moves to match data, handle the player validation in vuex and the turn validation in game panel -- use computed/watched to actually perform the moves in order from match data
*** TODO Game board should auto display a new move that comes in
*** TODO Might need to make the move verbose to capture stuff like promotions
* FUTURE
** TODO Add pgn info for current displayed position beneath board
** TODO Step forward/back through chess moves history
** TODO Who's turn is it? On game panel
*** White To Move, Black To Move, or Game Over
*** v-show for if its the current player's turn
** TODO Add vuelidate to message box to prevent blank messages
** TODO Do a big runthrough of stylings for each monitor breakpoint
*** Use both the big computer and laptop for each breakpoint
*** Use big computer for XL
*** Style the arrows, frames, and tiles
*** Remember the frames are undersized and should be scaled out
*** Fix styling on move input form between breakpoints as well
** TODO Observer mode handling
- Disable chat and moves for non-players
** TODO Game over handling
- Don't accept any more moves
- Display who won
** TODO Add footer with terms of use, github link, and credits to start page(s)
** TODO Change player validation to use public key method
** TODO Resign button (with client-side validation like a move)
** TODO Need a timeout for topic subbing (and visible error message)
** TODO Error handling for when move submit fails (revert to original state)
*** Should only fail if there's a loss of connection?
* BUGS
** The chat window doesn't scroll to the bottom on new messages
