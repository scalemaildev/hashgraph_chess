* NOW
** TODO Fix chat window flexboxes and get window to scroll on max messages
*** It isn't the slug page -> up
*** It's probably the match components page
* FUTURE
** TODO Get a chessboard.js with chess.js rules into the game page
** TODO Chess moves go to the chess moves array
**** Needs a validation that the move came from the current player(?)
**** Needs a validatino that the chess move was legal(?)
**** Chess.js might take care of the above
** TODO Modify chessboard to send and receive moves over HCS
** TODO Add a resume game feature to connect to an existing topic id
** TODO Limit moves and chat messages to valid account id's
*** Use the submit key feature for the topic messages
*** Will need to have another screen where player 1 is given the submit key to copy
*** Will need a panel on the game screen to enter the submit key
* BUGS
** DONE When refreshing the match page, the player will get an additional message from the sub for every page refresh (refreshing twice = three messages)
- This appears to be happening at the hashgraph sub so it might be duplicated subscriptions from page refreshes
