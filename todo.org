* NOW
** TODO Chess move input field
*** Text input field for square and another for move
*** Send button as well as form with enter key
*** Fix form submitting with invalid entries
*** Use pgn validation to validate the moves for the square (vuelidate)
*** Test with console.log() first
* FUTURE
** TODO Chess moves go to the chess moves array
**** Needs a validation that the move came from the current player(?)
**** Needs a validation that the chess move was legal(?)
**** Chess.js might take care of the above
** TODO Modify chessboard to send and receive moves over HCS
** TODO Add pgn info for current displayed position
** TODO Step forward/back through chess moves history
** TODO Who's turn is it? On game panel
*** v-show for whose turn on game panel
** TODO Do xl breakpoints and check everything on big monitor
** TODO Observer mode handling
- Disable chat and moves for non-players
** TODO Game over handling

- Display who won
** TODO Add footer with terms of use, github link, and credits to start page(s)
** TODO Need a timeout for topic subbing (and visible error message)
** TODO Limit moves and chat messages to valid account id's
*** Use the public key method from discord screens
* BUGS
